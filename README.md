# Catch The Fish

This extension is a fun experiment that adds a minigame fo Flarum.

Once enabled, admins or mods can create fish catching rounds.
The fishes will appear on the forum and visitors catch as many as they can.

It includes many customisation options.
You can let users change the fish names or choose the placement of the fish themselves.

All aspects of the game are controlled via Flarum permissions.

The extensions comes with a starting pack of (public domain images) fishes that you can include when creating a new round.

This is still a work in progress.
Most notably, you can't upload your own fish images for now (you can manually add them in the `assets/catch-the-fish` folder and update the database to work around it).
